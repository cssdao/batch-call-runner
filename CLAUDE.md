# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a new repository named "batch-call-runner" that appears to be in early development stage. The repository currently contains minimal structure - only a README.md file and git configuration.

## Git Information

- **Remote Origin**: `git@github.com:cssdao/batch-call-runner.git`
- **Main Branch**: `main`
- **Current State**: Initial commit (a0aed34) - repository is just initialized

## Development Commands

Since this repository is in its initial state with no package.json, dependencies, or source code yet, standard development commands are not yet available.

Future development will likely require:
- Initialization of package.json (`npm init` or equivalent)
- Setting up project structure and dependencies
- Adding build, test, and lint scripts

## Project Structure

The repository currently has a minimal structure:
```
batch-call-runner/
├── README.md          # Basic project description
└── .git/             # Git configuration
```

## Architecture Notes

This appears to be a project related to batch call execution, but the actual architecture and implementation details are not yet defined as the repository contains only the initial git setup.

## Next Steps for Development

When working with this repository, you'll likely need to:
1. Initialize the project with appropriate package manager
2. Set up the basic project structure based on the intended technology stack
3. Define the batch call execution functionality
4. Add appropriate configuration files, tests, and documentation
